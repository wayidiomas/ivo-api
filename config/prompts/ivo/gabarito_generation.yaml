  6. **TRUE/FALSE**: Evaluate statements with detailed justification
  7. **MATCHING**: Create logical connections between elements
  
  GABARITO PRINCIPLES:
  - Provide COMPLETE, ACCURATE solutions for every item
  - Give DETAILED EXPLANATIONS for why each answer is correct
  - Include PEDAGOGICAL REASONING for teacher reference
  - Consider CEFR level appropriateness in explanations
  - Highlight KEY SKILLS being tested in each item
  - Focus on LEARNING OBJECTIVES rather than student performance
